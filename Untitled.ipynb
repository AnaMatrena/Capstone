    "# Scikit model in a flask app on railway\n",
    "Don't understand a word of this heading? Let's translate.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, you've learned to set up scikit-learn models in Jupyter notebooks. But if you work for a client, how are they going to use your model? Surely they don't want to learn Python to get their predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is where flask apps come into play. [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) is a web application framework. It allows you to create an application which will nicely package your model into a box. The client will insert an observation and the application will return the prediction for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this application has to run somewhere. It could be on an internal company server, but it could also be hosted on a cloud. [Railway](https://railway.com/) offers infrastructure to run web applications and also provides databases where you can store the data - the observations and the predictions.\n",

    "## 0. tl;dr\n",
    "\n",
    "You can deploy your own model by\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Copying the contents of this repo to a new directory\n",
    "1. Replace `pipeline.pickle`, `dtypes.pickle`, and `columns.json` with\n",
    "   your own\n",
    "1. [Deploy to railway](#deploy-to-railway)\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll probably run into a few issues along the way which is why you'll at least want to\n",
    "skim the contents of the notebooks and this README, in order to have an idea of\n",
    "where to look when you hit a bump in the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simplistic yet effective way to deploy a scikit model behind a HTTP server on railway.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 4 main topics to cover here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Serialization\n",
    "    - This is covered in the notebooks\n",
    "1. Flask\n",
    "    - Covered here in the README\n",
    "1. Database connection\n",
    "    - Covered here in the README\n",
    "1. Deployment to railway\n",
    "    - Also covered here in the README\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Before you continue\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic #1 is the only one that is not covered here in this README. It is covered in two notebooks\n",
    "that you must read before moving on with the rest of this README.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Notebook #1](Step%201%20-%20Train%20and%20Serialize.ipynb) has to do with training and serializing a scikit model as well as how to prepare a new observation\n",
    "that arrives for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Notebook #2](Step%202%20-%20Deserialize%20and%20use.ipynb) has to do with deserialization so that you can use a trained model with new observations without having to re-train it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Python virtual environment\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably noticed that we have two requirement files in this repo: `requirements_dev.txt` and `requirements_prod.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `requirements_dev.txt` file has the packages that are needed while preparing the model and include jupyter and matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `requirements_prod.txt` file has the packages that are needed when we deploy our model. At that point, we won't need jupyter or matplotlib, so we can save some resources by not installing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now go ahead and create a python virtual env using the requirements in `requirements_dev.txt`, in order to follow this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you already read and understood the notebooks on serialization? Have you already tested your understanding\n",
    "by pickling and un-pickling your scikit model? Yes yes? Alrighty then, you may continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is flask\n",
    "\n",
    "[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is an HTTP micro-framework. It is a very minimal code library that allows\n",
    "for quick and simple HTTP server development and is a great alternative to bigger frameworks like Django.\n",
    "However, be wary before moving forward with a big project using flask - it can get out of hand very quickly\n",
    "without the enforced structure that other heavier frameworks like Django provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "For us, since we only need a total of two endpoints (an endpoint is the URL that is used to request an action from the server; in our case we will need two types of actions: requesting a prediction for an observation, and updating an observation's true class) and it doesn't even need to be [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), we can stick with\n",
    "flask and be reasonably justified in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### First steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Get a project started\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use flask, you will need to be writing some code in a regular\n",
    "python file - no more notebooks here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step (assuming you have already\n",
    "created an virtual environment and installed the requirements in `requirements.txt`), is to import flask at the top of the file. \n",
    "Let's pretend that we are working in a file called `app.py` in our newly created \n",
    "virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# the Flask object is for creating an HTTP server - you'll\n",
    "# see this a few lines down.\n",
    "# the request object does exactly what the name suggests: holds\n",
    "# all of the contents of an HTTP request that someone is making\n",
    "# the jsonify function is useful for when we want to return\n",
    "# json from the function we are using.\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "# here we use the Flask constructor to create a new\n",
    "# application that we can add routes to\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This server doesn't do anything yet. In order to make it do stuff we will\n",
    "need to add HTTP endpoints to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making HTTP endpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "With flask, creating an HTTP endpoint is incredibly simple, assuming that we already\n",
    "have the `app` object created from the `Flask` constructor. Let's make a single\n",
    "endpoint that will serve the predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    prediction = 0.5\n",
    "    return jsonify({\n",
    "        'prediction': prediction\n",
    "    })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above route that we have isn't very smart in that it returns the same\n",
    "prediction every time (0.5) and it doesn't actually care about the input\n",
    "that you sent it. But hey, with just a few lines of code we've almost created an entire server that serves a prediction!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making a complete server\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it all together with a few lines of code at the end (in order to start\n",
    "the server in development mode), we've created an entire server that \n",
    "can be run by executing `python app.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# these contents can be put into a file called app.py\n",
    "# and run by executing:\n",
    "# python app.py\n",
    "\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    prediction = 0.5\n",
    "    return jsonify({\n",
    "        'prediction': prediction\n",
    "    })\n",
    "    \n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to experiment with sending requests to your server, open a new terminal window and execute the following command, in order to get a prediction:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "~ > curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"prediction\": 0.5\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, now that we can run a full flask server, let's try to make something a bit more\n",
    "useful by receiving new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Receiving a new observation\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we've got a way to build an entire server, let's try to actually use the\n",
    "server to receive new information. There's a pretty nice way to do this via the\n",
    "[get_json](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/api/#flask.Request.get_json) flask function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this server, let's say that the model only takes a single field called `unemployed`\n",
    "and returns `true` if `unemployed` is true and `false` otherwise. The server would now\n",
    "look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    payload = request.get_json()\n",
    "    at_risk = payload['unemployed']\n",
    "    return jsonify({\n",
    "        'prediction': at_risk\n",
    "    })\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see the output with the following examples:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "~ > curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -d '{\"unemployed\": true}' -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"prediction\": true\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "~ > curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -d '{\"unemployed\": false}' -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"prediction\": false\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a quick note that we had to supply a header of `Content-Type:application/json`\n",
    "and json data of `{\"unemployed\": false}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrating with a scikit model\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how to get a python dictionary via the flask `get_json`\n",
    "function, we're at a point in which we can pick up where the last tutorial\n",
    "notebook left off! Let's tie it all together by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deserializing the model, columns, and dtypes\n",
    "1. Turn the new observation into a pandas dataframe\n",
    "1. Call `predict_proba` to get the likelihood of survival of the new observation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deserialize model, prep observation, predict\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import joblib\n",
    "import json\n",
    "import pickle\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "from flask import Flask, request, jsonify\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "with open('dtypes.pickle', 'rb') as fh:\n",

    "@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def predict():\n",
    "    payload = request.get_json()\n",
    "    obs = pd.DataFrame([payload], columns=columns).astype(dtypes)\n",
    "    proba = pipeline.predict_proba(obs)[0, 1]\n",
    "    return jsonify({\n",
    "        'prediction': proba\n",
    "    })\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out how we have now taken the payload and turned it into\n",
    "a new observation that is a single entry in a dataframe,\n",
    "and can be consumed by the pipeline to be turned into a prediction\n",
    "of survival. You can see the output with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "~ >  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -d '{\"Age\": 22.0, \"Cabin\": null, \"Embarked\": \"S\", \"Fare\": 7.25, \"Parch\": 0, \"Pclass\": 3, \"Sex\": \"male\", \"SibSp\": 1}' -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"prediction\": 0.16097398111735517\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Keeping track of your predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now that you can get data, produce predictions, and return those predictions,\n",
    "you will need to keep track of what you've been saying about who.\n",
    "Said another way: you can't just provide predictions and then just forget about it all. You need to\n",
    "take record of what you have predicted about who, so that later on you can do some additional analysis on your \"through the door\" population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we will need to start working with a database. The database\n",
    "will keep track of the observations, the predictions we have provided for them,\n",
    "and the true outcomes (should we be luckly enough to find out about them).\n",
    "\n",
    "### ORMs and peewee\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with databases in code, you generally want to be using a layer of abstraction\n",
    "called an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping). For this\n",
    "exercise we will use a very simplistic ORM called [peewee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/index.html).\n",
    "This will allow us to use a local database called [sqlite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite) (which is basically a file)\n",
    "when we are developing on our laptops, and use a more production-ready database called\n",
    "[postgresql](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) when deploying to railway, with very\n",
    "little change to our code.\n",
    "\n",
    "One cool thing that ORMs allow us to do is define the data model that we want\n",
    "to use in code. So let's use peewee to create a data model to keep track of\n",
    "predictions and the probabilities we have assigned to them. Once again, we can\n",
    "take care of this in a few lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "from peewee import (\n",
    "    SqliteDatabase, Model, IntegerField,\n",
    "    FloatField, TextField,\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "DB = SqliteDatabase('predictions.db')\n",
    "\n",
    "class Prediction(Model):\n",
    "    observation_id = IntegerField(unique=True)\n",
    "    observation = TextField()\n",
    "    proba = FloatField()\n",
    "    true_class = IntegerField(null=True)\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Meta:\n",
    "        database = DB\n",
    "\n",
    "DB.create_tables([Prediction], safe=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to take a moment to understand exactly how much these\n",
    "few lines of code have done for us because it is A LOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Connect to database\n",
    "\n",
    "`DB = SqliteDatabase('predictions.db')`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a sqlite database that will be stored in a file called `predictions.db`.\n",
    "This may seem trivial right now, but soon enough you will see that changing\n",
    "out this line of code for one other will result in a lot of value for the effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Define the data model\n",
    "\n",
    "`Class Prediction(Model)...`\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the data model that we will work with. The model has sections for\n",
    "the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `observation_id`\n",
    "    - There must be a unique identifier to all observations and it is\n",
    "      the responsibility of the person providing the observation to give\n",
    "      this id.\n",
    "- `observation`\n",
    "    - We should record the observation itself when it comes, in case\n",
    "      we want to retrain our model later on.\n",
    "- `proba`\n",
    "    - The probability of survival that we assigned to the observation.\n",
    "- `true_class`\n",
    "    - This is for later on, in case we find out what actually happened to the observation for which we supplied a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Create the table\n",
    "\n",
    "`DB.create_tables([Prediction], safe=True)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The model that we specified must correspond to a database table.\n",
    "Creation of these tables is something that is it's own non-trivial\n",
    "headache, and this one line of code makes it so that we don't have to worry about any of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Integrate data model with webserver\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "~ > curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict -d '{\"id\": 0, \"observation\": {\"Age\": 22.0, \"Cabin\": null, \"Embarked\": \"S\", \"Fare\": 7.25, \"Parch\": 0, \"Pclass\": 3, \"Sex\": \"male\", \"SibSp\": 1}}' -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n",

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take note of the few things that changed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The structure of the json input changed. It now includes two top level entries:\n",
    "    - `id` - This is the unique identifier of the observation;\n",
    "    - `observation` - This is the actual observation contents that will be sent through\n",
    "      the pipeline we have un-pickled.\n",
    "1. We create an instance of `Prediction` with the 3 fields that we care about.\n",
    "1. We call `save()` on the prediction to save it to the database.\n",
    "1. We return `proba` so that the caller of the HTTP endpoint knows what you are\n",
    "saying about the observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Receiving updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a way to provide predictions AND keep track of them, we should\n",
    "take it to the next level and provide ourselves with a way to receive updates\n",
    "on observations that we have judged with our predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do this with one extra endpoint that is very straightforward and only\n",
    "introduces one new concept: database querying through the ORM.\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "@app.route('/update', methods=['POST'])\n",
    "def update():\n",
    "    obs = request.get_json()\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        p = Prediction.get(Prediction.observation_id == obs['id'])\n",
    "        p.true_class = obs['true_class']\n",
    "        p.save()\n",
    "        return jsonify(model_to_dict(p))\n",
    "    except Prediction.DoesNotExist:\n",
    "        error_msg = 'Observation ID: \"{}\" does not exist'.format(obs['id'])\n",
    "        return jsonify({'error': error_msg})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that we have already processed an observation with id=0, we\n",
    "can now receive and record the true outcome. Imagine that it is discovered\n",
    "later on that the person with id=0 didn't survive the titanic disaster. They\n",
    "would probably enter something into a content management system that\n",
    "would then trigger a call to your server which would end up looking like\n",
    "the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "~ > curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/update -d '{\"id\": 0, \"true_class\": 0}'  -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"id\": 1,\n",

    "  \"proba\": 0.16097398111735517,\n",
    "  \"true_class\": 0\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to when we saved the prediction requests, we validate that the observation_id we want to update actually exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to wrap it all up, the way that we can interpret this sequence of events is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We provided a prediction of 0.161 probability of survival;\n",
    "1. We found out later that the person didn't survive.\n",
    "\n",

    "rebuilding in railway.\n",
    "\n",
    " And boom! We're done and deployed! You can actually see this working by executing\n",
    " some of the curl commands that we saw before but using the URL we've obtained before from railway, rather than `http://localhost` like we saw earlier. For my app it looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " ```bash\n",
    " ~ > curl -X POST https://<given_url>/predict -d '{\"id\": 0, \"observation\": {\"Age\": 22.0, \"Cabin\": null, \"Embarked\": \"S\", \"Fare\": 7.25, \"Parch\": 0, \"Pclass\": 3, \"Sex\": \"male\", \"SibSp\": 1}}' -H \"Content-Type:application/json\"\n",

    "  \"true_class\": 1\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "How does all of this work you ask? Well, it has to do with the fact\n",
    "that there exists a `Dockerfile` this repo.\n",
    "Just be sure that this file is in your repo and that they are\n",
    "committed before you build your app in railway, and everything should work. If you\n",
    "do a deploy and it doesn't work, take a look at the files and see\n",
    "if you might have done something such as change a filename or something\n",
    "else that would break the boilerplate assumptions that we've made here.\n",
    "### Import problems\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using something like a custom transformer, and getting an import error having to do with your custom code\n",
    "when unpickling, you'll need to do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Put your custom code in a package\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that you have a custom transformer, called `MyCustomTransformer`, that is part of your\n",
    "pickled pipeline. In that case, you'll want to create a [python package](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Modules_and_Packages)\n",
    "from which you import the custom transformer, in both your training and deployment code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, let's create the following package called `custom_transformers` by just creating a directory\n",
    "with the same name and putting two files inside of it so that it looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "└── custom_transformers\n",
    "    ├── __init__.py\n",
    "    └── transformer.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And inside of `transformer.py` you can put the code for `MyCustomTransformer`. Then, in your training code, you can import them with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "from custom_transformers.transformer import MyCustomTransformer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you un-pickle your model, python should be able to find the custom transformer too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dependecies from your custom transformer should be added to the two `requirements.txt` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Last few notes\n",
    "\n",
    "There were are few additional changes to `app.py` and the rest of the repo that we haven't covered yet, so\n",
    "let's get that out of the way. You probably won't need to know much about them but if you are having\n",
    "troubleshooting issues, knowing the following may come in handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The db connector\n",
    "\n",
    "When our app is running on railway, we want to connect to a postgres database, rather than to a sqlite one.\n",
    "Thus, we had to change the code related to our SqliteDatabase with something that takes care of this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "import os\n",
    "from playhouse.db_url import connect\n",
    "\n",
    "# the connect function checks if there is a DATABASE_URL env var\n",
    "# if it exists, it uses it to connect to a remote postgres db\n",
    "# otherwise, it connects to a local sqlite db stored in the predictions.db file\n",
    "DB = connect(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL') or 'sqlite:///predictions.db')\n",
